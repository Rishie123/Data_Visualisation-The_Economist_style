# Notes to editor

In this file, I will:

1. Summarise the style guidelines relevant to my article
2. Mention which ones I did and did not use
3. Describe the alterations needed to make to make them submittable to the magazine team.


## 1. Relevant Style guidelines

1. We are supposed to use a rotated red tag at top
2. Size of our plot for 3 columns, should be 504pts(672px) by 165 pts
3. Use the type face Econ Sans in the plot
4. Get the heading inside the plot at the left corner below the tag
5. Use the colour palette for line and stacked bar plot

### 2. Style guidelines followed

1. Did make the vertical red tag in both my plot
2. Did use recommended plot size for the plot to cover 3 columns
3. Did download and use the Econ Sans Cnd font
4. Got the heading inside the plot at the left corner below the tag
5. Did use the colour palette as in the guidelines for line and stacked bar plot

### 3. Alternations needed before submission

I have attempted to follow as many style guidelines as was possible for me, although, I believe, there could still be a few things, to make the article directly submittable to the editor.

#### Additional Notes

 The data set has been downloaded from the link: https://werd.stanford.edu/ in xlsx format and converted to csv as it saves space and can be accessessed by completely open-source softwares.

 I have preffered a tex file over a word file, due to it not requiring licensed softwares to open it.

 The article should be easily "reproducible" in a few steps.

I have given due credit to the authors and creators of the database and have followed their license on using their data, to make my data product "ethical".
